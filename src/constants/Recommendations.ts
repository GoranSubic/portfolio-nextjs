We started working with Goran in November 2021. Before that, he did online training with the help of one of our developers as his mentor. Goran was very dedicated during the training period, he came back with the solutions for the tasks promptly. He was also paying attention to the feedback given and could update his code based on them. He took effective steps to develop his knowledge and skills. \n
When he had to work on client projects, he could report about his tasks in a team and business setting (with clients) in written English. He was able to dig deeper into specific fields as directed. Goran delivered meaningful work as a member of the team doing the tasks assigned to him. Unfortunately, the communication slowed down with the client, and we couldn't find other projects for him to contribute to, so we had to pause our cooperation. \n
As Goran's dedication is unquestionable, he works hard on the tasks assigned to him, and he delivers quality solutions, I think he is a great fit for the developer position. \n
