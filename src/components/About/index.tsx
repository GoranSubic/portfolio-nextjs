        <p>
          My name is Goran SubiÄ‡, I&apos;m an IT professional with more than 10 years of experience in the industry.
          <br /><br />
          Most of my experience  lies in backend development, where I&apos;ve worked extensively with PHP and frameworks such as Symfony, Laravel, and Zend.
          <br />
          Lastly, I gained experience working on project using NodeJS, Express, TypeScript, Prisma.
          <br /><br />
          I have experience in frontend development as well. Projects that I have maintained on the frontend side are made moslty using Vue JS.
          <br />
          Also, I gained experience using NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS. This portfolio was made using that stack.
          <br /><br />
          I&apos;m a developer who is dedicated to the job and writes code that I believe you can be proud of :)
          You can check my portfolio here at <a href="https://goransubic.vercel.app/" target="_blank">https://goransubic.vercel.app/</a> and on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/GoranSubic/portfolio-nextjs" target="_blank">https://github.com/GoranSubic/portfolio-nextjs</a> where you will find my CV and important information about my education and work experience.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to my portfolio, which was built using Next JS + TypeScript + TailwindCSS, I am currently working on a few projects.
          <br />
          One of these (which I could present to you) is a project created with Symfony and Vue.js: <a href="https://alternativa8.rs/" target="_blank">https://alternativa8.rs/</a>.
          <br />
          Another project, I&apos;ve developed uses NodeJS + Express + Prisma for the backend, with plans to complete the frontend using Next.js.
          <br />
          Also, there are a couple of projects on my GitHub profile, which I&apos;ve created for practice and learning purposes.
          <br /><br />
          I believe I can be a valuable addition to your team thanks to my experience as a team player,
          my expertise in various technologies, and my strong desire to continue learning and improving my skills.
          <br />
          Throughout my career, I&apos;ve had the privilege of working with great people, delivering quality work, and effectively handling various pressures along the way.
